### Setup

1. To get most of the python packages you need, [install Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads#all)
2. Version control your work and [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account to collaborate easily with others
   - I recommend using command-line
   - or install a Github compatible GUI.  Github provides one but [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is supposed to be better.
4. Regardless of which instructions you followed, you may want to install a better text-editor.  Sublime Text, Notepad++ for Windows, and Textmate for Macs are recommended.  Emacs and Vim are also still popular, but they do have steeper learning curves.

for **Windows** you can also install all those things, but installing a Ubuntu Virtual Machine is recommended.
The Berkeley Common Environment [(BCE)](http://bce.berkeley.edu/) maintains a virtual Ubuntu environment that you can download and install a copy of.

- [Installation instructions](http://bce.berkeley.edu/install.html)

If you're new to linux, this [tutorial](http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php) for using the Terminal might be helpful.  These commands will also be reviewed in class.
